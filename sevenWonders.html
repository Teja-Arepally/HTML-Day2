        <p><b><u>Description:</u></b></p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife 
        Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara 
        Begum.[12][13] Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648,
         while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.</p><hr>

        <p><b><u>Description:</u></b></p>
        <p>The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of 
        the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC.[24] During this time 
        and the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan,
        and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders.[25][26]
        Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made 
        mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.</p><hr>
        <center><h2>3.Petra</h2></center>
        <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/The_Monastery%2C_Petra%2C_Jordan8.jpg/250px-The_Monastery%2C_Petra%2C_Jordan8.jpg" alt="Petra" width="400" Height="400"></center>
        <p><b><u>Description:</u></b></p>
        <p>The Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited
        by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of 
        whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, "ranks highest
        in the land of the Arabs" and was still called Rekeme by all the Arabs of his time, after its 
        royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7).[20] The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified 
        Rekem as Petra.[21] Arabic raqama means "to mark, to decorate", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean 
        word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from
        the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script.
        One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu
        (Jerash).</p><hr>
        <center><h2>4.Colosseum</h2></center>
        <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Rome_Colosseum_exterior_panorama.jpg/250px-Rome_Colosseum_exterior_panorama.jpg" alt="Colosseum" width="400" Height="400"></center>
        <p><b><u>Description:</u></b></p>
        <p>The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced 
        concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its 
        history,[4][5] having an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial 
        contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous 
        battles, dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to
        be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as 
        housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian 
        shrine.</p><hr>
        <center><h2>5.Chichén Itzá</h2></center>
        <center><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/49/61349-050-9FFBEB28/El-Castillo-pyramid-plaza-Toltec-state-Yucatan.jpg" alt="Chichén Itzá" width="500" Height="500"></center>
        <p><b><u>Description:</u></b></p>
        <p>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the
        9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the 
        Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the 
        stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main 
        Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 
        365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, 
        the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent slithering 
        down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life there was not all work and 
        science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in 
        the Americas. On that field the residents played a ritual ball game popular throughout 
        pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.</p><hr>
        <center><h2>6.Machu Picchu</h2></center>
        <center><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/30/94530-050-99493FEA/Machu-Picchu.jpg?w=300" alt="Machu Picchu" width="500" Height="500"></center>
        <p><b><u>Description:</u></b></p>
        <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who believed 
        it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against
        Spanish rule. Although that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has 
        confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who 
        lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site,
        while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently should not be is the site of
        a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being used for such an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What is 
        known is that Machu Picchu is one of the few major pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact.</p><hr>
        <center><h2>7.Christ the Redeemer</h2></center>
        <center><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/54/150754-050-5B93A950/statue-Christ-the-Redeemer-Rio-de-Janeiro.jpg?w=300" alt="Christ the Redeemer" width="400" Height="400"></center>
        <p><b><u>Description:</u></b></p>
        <p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de 
        Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of
        godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, 
        Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years 
        later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its base, which 
        is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is
        the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is made of reinforced 
        concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Somewhat disconcertingly, 
        the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of Jesus’s right thumb
        was damaged during a storm.</p><hr>
